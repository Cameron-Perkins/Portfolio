This is the to do list
TODO:
Now I need to get the betting loop right.
The loop is breaking after all players have taken thier turn.
We need it to break when all players have folded are called.
The problem can be broken down into dectect when len(players) == 1 
the loop breaks then.
Break when all players have called.
But the problem is the loop is breaking early
WHY
Maybe its because 
loop just broke after that changes
